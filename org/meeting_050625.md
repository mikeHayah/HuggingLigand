## Project base
Usage of existing project by Ramy Boulos (https://github.com/RamyBoulos/scensage). Currently the project uses an LLM to analyze movie subtitles to (1) divide them into scenes or (2) find tone and cultural emotions based on those.

## Project ideas
* detection of emotions from movie scenes with CNN/vision transformer
* benchmarking the current results and try to improve by using different models
* translate subtitles while preserving format
* sign language translator from subtitles
